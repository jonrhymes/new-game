<h1>GA Project 1: Game</h1>
  <h2>Duo: a comparative card game featuring some of my favorite musicians!</h2>

<p>
A deck of 52 cards is divvied up between player and computer. One card is compared against the other. If one value is greater, then both cards are added to the winner's deck. If the card values are equal, both cards are removed from play. The player who takes all the cards wins!
