<h1>GA Project 1: Game</h1>
  <h2>Duo: A comparative card game featuring some of my favorite musicians!</h2>

<p>
A deck of 52 cards is divvied up between player and computer. One card is compared against the other. If one value is greater, then both cards are added to the winner's deck. If the card values are equal, both cards are removed from play. The player who takes all the cards wins!

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Google Fonts, favicon, Animista

Approach taken: I originally wanted to make a game that was more complex than the one I landed on, commonly known as Shithead. Only by attempting to recreate it did I discover that I took the wrong approach. So I simplified the game to be more like War, but without the War stage. I researched ways to build a deck, shuffle the deck and lastly, deploy the game. I'm happy with the results. I loved creating the cards in Photoshop and utilizing them in the game. Also, I like the site design.
